# How this works:
# 1. If 'url' (singular) exists, it's treated as a single URL (legacy)
# 2. If 'urls' (plural) exists, it can be:
#    a. List of strings: ["url1", "url2"] - all use source-level settings
#    b. List of objects: [{url, folder, extract_from_archive}, ...] - per-URL settings
# 3. Settings inheritance:
#    - url: required in each URL object
#    - folder: URL-level overrides source-level, defaults to ""
#    - extract_from_archive: URL-level overrides source-level
# 4. Source-level operations (rename) run after all URLs processed

# Use cases:
# - Download multi-part archives from same site
# - Collect BIOS files from different regional sources
# - Download large collections split across multiple files
# - Combine files from different folders into one location
