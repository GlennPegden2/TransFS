# TransFS  
*A Virtual Translation Filesystem for Archive-Based Content*

**TransFS** is a FUSE-based virtual filesystem that presents structured, emulator-friendly views of software archives (e.g., ROMs, BIOS, software packs) without modifying their original format. By dynamically mapping archive.org content into the file layouts required by various emulation platforms, TransFS eliminates the need for local file extraction, renaming, or repackaging.

## üîç Key Features

- **FUSE-powered virtual filesystem** ‚Äì Present data download from archive.org in the format expected by various apps (e.g. emulators).
- **Zero modification** ‚Äì Original archive content remains untouched; translations occur in-memory.
- **Smart naming & structure** ‚Äì Automatically adapts files/folders to the conventions of target emulators/platforms.
- **ROMset and BIOS handling** ‚Äì Merge split ROMs, unzip on-demand, or reshape sets for compatibility.
- **Dockerised deployment** ‚Äì Fully containerised SMB server for network-based sharing with retro devices and VMs.
- **Extensible plugin system** ‚Äì Support additional emulators, platforms, or structural conventions.

## üì¶ Use Cases

- Retro emulation environments (e.g. RetroArch, MAME, MiSTer)
- Software preservation setups
- Testing environments requiring specific file layout conventions
- Dynamic presentation of large archive.org datasets via Samba/SMB

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

- Linux (FUSE support)
- Docker (if using containerised mode)
- Python 3.9+ (for non-containerised dev mode)
- `fuse3` / `libfuse` installed

### Quick Start (Dockerised SMB Mode)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/transfs.git
cd transfs
docker-compose up -d
```

### Notes on Windows (either running locally or as Host OS for containers)

If windows binds SMB to 443 (as it will want to), we can't bind too, so the SMB server can't run (and SMB doesn't play nicely with many clients when run on other ports).

Possible solutions are

- Don't run this on Windows (or a linux/Mac system whene you are already running and SMB server)
- Run it inside WSL (either as a container or not)
- Erm, yeah, I can test locally ny running it on 4443 as recent insider builds of windows allow you to map shares to other ports, but there are still loads of things out there that assume it's on 443.


### Project Name

This name TransFS was chosen because it translates between one expected dir structure and another
It has nothing specifically to do with the Trans community
